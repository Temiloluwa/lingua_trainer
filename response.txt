Guten Morgen! Danke. Ich habe drei Jahre Projektmanagement Erfahrung und Teamleitung.

Great job! Just a small correction: "Projektmanagement" should be written as one word. Keep up the good work!feedback: Good attempt! However, the word "Guten" is missing at the beginning of the sentence. Remember to start with the correct greeting in German. Give it another try!

Hint: What is the German word for "morning"?

feedback: Great job on the greeting! Now, let's work on the second part of the sentence. The word "Vielen" is missing after the greeting. It means "many" or "a lot" in English. Give it another try!

Hint: How do you say "thank you" in German?

feedback: Excellent! You got the first two parts correct. Now, let's focus on the last part of the sentence. Instead of "in Projektmanagement und Teamf端hrung," we need to use "von Erfahrung" to indicate "years of experience." Give it another try!

Hint: How do you say "years of experience" in German?

feedback: Fantastic! You got the first three parts correct. Now, let's work on the last part of the sentence. Instead of "in Projektmanagement und Teamf端hrung," we need to use "in Projektmanagement und Teamf端hrung." Give it another try!

Hint: How do you say "in project management and team leadership" in German?

feedback: Well done! You have successfully translated the sentence. The correct translation is "Guten Morgen! Vielen Dank. Ich habe drei Jahre Erfahrung in Projektmanagement und Teamf端hrung."

Great job on your persistence! You've got it right! Well done!
